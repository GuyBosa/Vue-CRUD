# vue-crud-app
This SPA is created using Vue 3, vue-router, bootstrap, sweetalert2, axios and a mock API from mock-api.binaryboxtuts.com
![screencapture-localhost-8080-2024-05-05-02_25_11](https://github.com/GuyBosa/Vue-CRUD/assets/40579537/a8f0cd52-8690-4005-9743-d057955e5628)

The use of mock API is due to its compatibility with Get, Post, Patch and Delete API calls, as well as its ease of use with regards to accessing the Base URL provided and uncovering its concealed API KEY.
